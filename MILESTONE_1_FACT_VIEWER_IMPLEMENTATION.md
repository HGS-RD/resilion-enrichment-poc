# Milestone 1: Fact Viewer Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Resilion Enrichment Fact Viewer as a foundational component for displaying hierarchical organization data. This milestone establishes the core viewer infrastructure with mock data and placeholder components for future development.

## Implementation Details

### 1. TypeScript Type Definitions (`apps/web/lib/types/viewer.ts`)
- **Comprehensive data model** matching the hierarchical JSON blueprint
- **Core interfaces**: Evidence, Contact, Person, Certification, Product, Technology, Capability, Site, Organization
- **Viewer-specific types**: EnrichmentViewerData, SiteMapPin, OrganizationSummary
- **Fully typed** for type safety and developer experience

### 2. API Route (`apps/web/app/api/organization/[domain]/route.ts`)
- **RESTful endpoint**: `GET /api/organization/[domain]`
- **Mock data service** for Stepan Company with realistic sample data
- **Hierarchical structure** with 2 sites (Vlissingen Plant, Northfield HQ)
- **Evidence-based facts** with confidence scores and source URLs
- **Next.js 15 compatible** with proper async params handling

### 3. Viewer Page Component (`apps/web/app/viewer/[domain]/page.tsx`)
- **Dynamic routing** supporting any domain parameter
- **Organization overview card** with key metrics and financial summary
- **Map placeholder** for Milestone 2 implementation
- **Sites data table placeholder** for Milestone 3 implementation
- **Quick stats dashboard** showing total sites, personnel, and certifications
- **Loading states** and error handling
- **Responsive design** using Tailwind CSS

### 4. Navigation Integration (`apps/web/components/navigation.tsx`)
- **New menu item**: "Organization Viewer" with Eye icon
- **Direct link** to stepan.com viewer for testing
- **Consistent styling** with existing navigation patterns

## Mock Data Structure
The implementation includes comprehensive mock data for Stepan Company:

### Organization Level
- Company name, website, headquarters, industry
- Financial summary ($2.5B revenue)
- Contact information with evidence

### Site Level (2 sites)
- **Vlissingen Plant** (Netherlands)
  - Manufacturing facility with geocoordinates
  - ISO 9001:2015 certification
  - Alpha Olefin Sulfonates production
  - Ethoxylation technology capabilities
  - ISCC PLUS sustainability certification

- **Northfield Headquarters** (USA)
  - Corporate HQ and R&D facility
  - Research & Development capabilities
  - No geocoordinates (tests optional mapping)

### Evidence System
- Each fact includes evidence with:
  - Source URL and snippet
  - Confidence score (0.78-0.95)
  - Verification timestamp
  - Tier classification (Tier 1/2)

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **shadcn/ui** component library

### API Design
- **RESTful endpoints** following Next.js conventions
- **Async/await patterns** for data fetching
- **Error handling** with proper HTTP status codes
- **JSON responses** matching TypeScript interfaces

### Data Flow
1. User navigates to `/viewer/[domain]`
2. Page component fetches from `/api/organization/[domain]`
3. API returns hierarchical organization data
4. Component renders with loading states and error handling

## Testing Results
✅ **Successful deployment** on localhost:3002
✅ **Navigation integration** working correctly
✅ **API endpoint** returning proper JSON data
✅ **UI rendering** with professional layout
✅ **Mock data display** showing all key metrics
✅ **Responsive design** across different screen sizes
✅ **Error handling** for loading and error states

## Future Milestone Preparation

### Milestone 2: Interactive Map
- Map placeholder is ready for implementation
- Geocoded sites data structure in place
- SiteMapPin interface defined for map markers

### Milestone 3: Sites Data Table
- Table placeholder prepared
- Full site data available in API response
- Filtering and sorting interfaces ready

### Database Integration
- Type definitions ready for database mapping
- API structure prepared for database queries
- Evidence system designed for fact verification

## Files Created/Modified
- `apps/web/lib/types/viewer.ts` (NEW)
- `apps/web/app/api/organization/[domain]/route.ts` (NEW)
- `apps/web/app/viewer/[domain]/page.tsx` (NEW)
- `apps/web/components/navigation.tsx` (MODIFIED)

## Key Features Delivered
1. **Hierarchical Data Display** - Organization → Sites → Details
2. **Evidence-Based Facts** - Every fact includes source and confidence
3. **Professional UI** - Clean, modern interface with proper loading states
4. **Type Safety** - Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
5. **Extensible Architecture** - Ready for map and table implementations
6. **Mock Data Service** - Realistic test data for development

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Viewer loads successfully at `/viewer/stepan.com`
- ✅ Organization data displays correctly
- ✅ Navigation integration works
- ✅ API returns proper JSON structure
- ✅ UI is responsive and professional
- ✅ Code is type-safe and well-documented

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the Resilion Enrichment Fact Viewer, with clear pathways for the interactive map (Milestone 2) and detailed sites table (Milestone 3) implementations.
