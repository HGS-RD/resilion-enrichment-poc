# Milestone 3 Completion Summary: Advanced Enrichment Logic & Job Management

**Completion Date**: December 30, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Timeline**: 2 weeks (as planned)

## Overview

Milestone 3 successfully implemented the sophisticated multi-tier enrichment chaining logic, job lifecycle management with timeouts and retries, and Tier 3 news sourcing integration. This milestone transforms the Resilion Enrichment POC into a production-grade system capable of handling complex, long-running enrichment jobs with robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.

- Processes up to 5 relevant news articles per job
- Applies news-specific confidence adjustments based on source reputation and article age
- Maps facts to news-specific types (e.g., `news_facility_name`, `news_expansion_plan`)
- Handles cases where no news articles are found gracefully

### 5. Advanced Enrichment Orchestrator ✅ **COMPLETED**

**File**: `apps/web/lib/services/advanced-enrichment-orchestrator.ts`

**Key Features Implemented**:
- **System Integration**: Main orchestrator that brings together all Milestone 3 components
- **Configuration Management**: Configurable confidence thresholds, timeouts, and tier enablement
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks for all system components
- **Statistics and Monitoring**: Real-time statistics on active jobs and retry queue
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup and shutdown procedures
- **Integration Helper**: Static method for easy integration with existing system

**Technical Implementation**:
- Coordinates between chaining engine, lifecycle manager, and tier processors
- Provides unified interface for job execution and monitoring
- Supports dynamic configuration updates
- Implements health status reporting (healthy/degraded/unhealthy)
- Designed for easy integration with existing enrichment system

## Evidence & Confidence Implementation ✅ **COMPLETED**

All extracted facts now include comprehensive evidence and confidence tracking:

- **Source Text**: Every fact includes the exact text snippet from which it was extracted
- **Source URL**: Direct link to the source document or webpage
- **Confidence Score**: Numerical confidence score (0.0 to 1.0) based on extraction method and context
- **Tier Attribution**: Each fact is tagged with the tier (1, 2, or 3) from which it was extracted
- **Enhanced Metadata**: Additional context like article titles, publication dates, and source types for news facts

## Acceptance Criteria Verification ✅

All acceptance criteria have been successfully implemented:

- ✅ **Tier Progression**: An enrichment job correctly moves from Tier 1 to Tier 2 if confidence threshold is not met
- ✅ **Early Termination**: A job stops after a tier if confidence threshold is satisfied  
- ✅ **Timeout Enforcement**: A job that runs for over 30 minutes is marked as failed and resources cleaned up
- ✅ **Retry Logic**: A failed job is automatically retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- ✅ **Complete Evidence**: All facts have non-null source_text, source_url, confidence_score, and tier_used fields
- ✅ **Partial Success**: The partial_success status is correctly applied if a job completes some tiers but fails on a later one
