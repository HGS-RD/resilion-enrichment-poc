# Milestone 2: EnrichmentAgent Core Logic - Implementation Summary

**Branch:** `feature/backend-core`  
**Completed:** December 29, 2025

## âœ… Tasks Completed

### 1. API Endpoint for Domain Acceptance
- **File:** `apps/web/app/api/enrichment/route.ts`
- **Features:**
  - POST endpoint to create new enrichment jobs
  - Domain validation with regex pattern matching
  - Idempotency check to prevent duplicate jobs
  - GET endpoint to retrieve job status and history
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging

### 2. Enrichment Job Storage
- **Database Integration:** PostgreSQL with existing schema
- **Job Status Tracking:** pending â†’ running â†’ completed/failed
- **Step Status Tracking:** Individual status for each chain step
- **Progress Metrics:** Pages crawled, chunks created, embeddings generated
- **Audit Trail:** Complete job logs and error tracking

### 3. Chain-of-Responsibility Pattern Implementation

#### Web Crawler Service (`apps/web/lib/services/crawler.ts`)
- **Technology:** Puppeteer for dynamic content rendering
- **Features:**
  - Ethical crawling with robots.txt respect
  - Configurable delays and timeouts
  - Content extraction from main page areas
  - Multi-page crawling within same domain
  - Resource cleanup and error handling

#### Text Chunking Service (`apps/web/lib/services/chunker.ts`)
- **Algorithm:** Sentence-based chunking with overlap
- **Features:**
  - Configurable chunk sizes (default: 1000 chars)
  - Smart overlap for context preservation (default: 200 chars)
  - Text cleaning and preprocessing
  - Chunking statistics and analytics
  - UUID-based chunk identification

### 4. Pinecone Integration (`apps/web/lib/services/embeddings.ts`)
- **Embedding Model:** OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dimensions)
- **Features:**
  - Batch processing for efficiency
  - Automatic Pinecone index creation
  - Metadata storage with job and chunk information
  - Vector similarity search capabilities
  - Error handling and rate limiting

### 5. Chain Orchestration (`apps/web/lib/services/enrichment-chain.ts`)
- **Pattern:** Chain-of-Responsibility with step validation
- **Steps Implemented:**
  - `CrawlingStep`: Web content extraction
  - `ChunkingStep`: Text segmentation
  - `EmbeddingStep`: Vector generation and storage
- **Features:**
  - Step status tracking in database
  - Progress updates and logging
  - Error recovery and rollback
  - Conditional step execution

### 6. Main EnrichmentAgent (`apps/web/lib/services/enrichment-agent.ts`)
- **Orchestration:** Complete workflow management
- **Features:**
  - Job lifecycle management (start, retry, cancel)
  - Progress calculation and reporting
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Resource cleanup and connection pooling

### 7. Data Model Documentation (`apps/web/lib/types/enrichment.ts`)
- **Comprehensive Types:** All interfaces and types documented
- **Database Models:** EnrichmentJob, EnrichmentFact structures
- **Service Configurations:** Crawler, Chunking, Embedding configs
- **Chain Patterns:** Step and Context interfaces

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Chain-of-Responsibility Flow
```
EnrichmentAgent â†’ EnrichmentChain â†’ [CrawlingStep â†’ ChunkingStep â†’ EmbeddingStep]
```

### Data Flow
```
Domain â†’ Crawled Pages â†’ Text Chunks â†’ Embeddings â†’ Pinecone Storage
```

### Database Integration
- Job status tracking with step-level granularity
- Progress metrics for monitoring
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Error tracking and retry mechanisms

## ðŸ“Š Key Features Implemented

1. **Ethical Web Crawling**
   - Robots.txt compliance
   - Configurable delays between requests
   - Dynamic content rendering with Puppeteer

2. **Intelligent Text Processing**
   - Sentence-based chunking for better context
   - Configurable overlap for information preservation
   - Text cleaning and preprocessing

3. **Vector Database Integration**
   - OpenAI embeddings with latest model
   - Pinecone storage with metadata
   - Batch processing for efficiency

4. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Step-level error tracking
   - Automatic retry mechanisms
   - Comprehensive logging system

5. **API Design**
   - RESTful endpoints for job management
   - Idempotency for reliable operations
   - Progress tracking and status monitoring

## ðŸš€ API Endpoints

### Create Enrichment Job
```
POST /api/enrichment
Body: { "domain": "example.com" }
```

### Get Job Status
```
GET /api/enrichment?id={jobId}
GET /api/enrichment?domain={domain}
```

### Start Enrichment Process
```
POST /api/enrichment/{id}/start
GET /api/enrichment/{id}/start (for status)
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Tracking

Each job tracks:
- Overall status (pending/running/completed/failed)
- Step-level status for each chain component
- Progress metrics (pages, chunks, embeddings)
- Detailed logs and error messages

## ðŸ”„ Git Commits

1. **Web Crawler Service** - Puppeteer-based crawling with ethical practices
2. **Text Chunking Service** - Intelligent sentence-based segmentation
3. **Embedding & Chain Services** - Pinecone integration with chain pattern
4. **EnrichmentAgent & APIs** - Main orchestrator and REST endpoints
5. **Dependencies** - UUID package for chunk identification

## âœ… Milestone 2 Status: COMPLETE

All required tasks have been implemented:
- âœ… API endpoint to accept domain names
- âœ… Enrichment job storage with "pending" status
