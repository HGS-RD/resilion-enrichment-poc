## 1. High-Level Architecture Summary

The system will be a monorepo application composed of three main components:

*   **Next.js Frontend:** A web interface for triggering enrichment jobs, visualizing the workflow status via a Mermaid.js diagram, and reviewing the extracted data. It will communicate with the backend via API calls.
*   **AI SDK Backend (TypeScript/Node.js):** The core orchestration layer responsible for managing the enrichment workflow. It will handle job initialization, execute the multi-step enrichment chain (crawling, chunking, embedding, extraction, scoring), and persist results. It will expose API endpoints for the frontend.
*   **Data Stores:**
    *   **DigitalOcean Managed Postgres:** To store structured data, including enrichment job statuses, extracted facts (in JSONB format), and error logs.
    *   **Pinecone:** To store vector embeddings of the evidence text chunks for semantic search and retrieval.

The entire application will be deployed on the **DigitalOcean App Platform**, leveraging its integrated CI/CD capabilities.

## 2.5. Git Workflow and Best Practices

All development will follow git best practices with frequent commits and proper branching:

### Branch Strategy
*   **main:** Production-ready code only
*   **feature/[milestone-name]:** Feature branches for each milestone
*   **feature/[ticket-number]-[description]:** Individual ticket branches for larger features

### Commit Standards
*   **Conventional Commits:** Use format `type(scope): description`
*   **Types:** feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
*   **Frequency:** Commit after each logical unit of work (minimum daily)
*   **Messages:** Clear, descriptive commit messages explaining the "what" and "why"

### Pull Request Process
*   All feature branches must be reviewed via Pull Request before merging to main
*   Include tests and documentation updates in PRs
*   Squash commits when merging to maintain clean history

## 5. Recommended Reusable Code Patterns or Frameworks

*   **Chain-of-Responsibility Pattern:** For the enrichment agent, where each step (`crawl`, `embed`, `extract`, etc.) is a handler in the chain. This makes the workflow modular and extensible.
*   **Repository Pattern:** To abstract data access, creating a clear separation between business logic and data persistence (e.g., `PostgresRepository`, `PineconeRepository`).
*   **Typed Interfaces:** Use TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `IEnrichmentFact`) that mirror the JSON schema to ensure type safety throughout the application.
*   **Prompt Registry:** Store and manage prompts in a dedicated `prompts/` directory, versioning them like code.

---

## 6. Testing and Validation Approach (99% Coverage Target)

Our testing strategy aims for **99% code coverage** with comprehensive automated testing at all levels, including visual regression testing to ensure UI consistency.

### Testing Stack
*   **Unit & Integration Testing:** Vitest with Istanbul coverage reporting
*   **Visual Regression Testing:** Playwright with screenshot comparison
*   **E2E Testing:** Playwright for full user journey validation
*   **Coverage Enforcement:** CI/CD pipeline configured to fail builds below 99% coverage threshold

---

## 7. Deployment Plan and Environment Variables

### Deployment
*   **Platform:** The application will be deployed as a single monorepo to the DigitalOcean App Platform. The `app.yaml` (or equivalent configuration) will define the build and run commands for the Next.js service.
*   **CI/CD:** Deployment will be triggered automatically on pushes to the `main` branch via GitHub integration.

### Environment Variables
All secrets and configurations will be managed through the DigitalOcean App Platform's environment variable settings:

*   `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for Postgres.
*   `PINECONE_API_KEY`: API key for Pinecone.
*   `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`: Pinecone environment name.
*   `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or equivalent LLM provider key).
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: To control application log verbosity (e.g., `info`, `debug`).

---

## 8. Known Risks or Dependencies

*   **Data Sparsity:** Public data for certain domains may be sparse or inaccurate, impacting the confidence of extracted facts.
*   **LLM Reliability:** LLM hallucinations or schema violations are a risk. This will be mitigated by strong prompt engineering, schema validation, and retry logic.
*   **Third-Party API Limits:** Rate limits on the LLM provider or other data sources could slow down enrichment.
*   **Scope Creep:** The POC must strictly adhere to the defined scope, avoiding the temptation to add complex features like advanced visualization or user management.

---

## 9. Assumptions

*   The AI SDK and other core libraries will be sufficient for the POC's needs without requiring significant custom workarounds.
*   The DigitalOcean App Platform will support the necessary build processes and runtime environment.
*   Access to the required API keys (LLM, Pinecone) will be available at the start of development.
*   The initial set of public data sources (corporate websites, press releases) will be sufficient to meet the 80% confidence success criteria for the pilot.

---

## 10. Additional Recommendations for Plan Enhancement

### Critical Gaps & Missing Considerations

*   **Gap: Data Source Resiliency.**
    *   **Observation:** The current plan relies heavily on crawling corporate websites, which can be brittle.
    *   **Recommendation:** Add at least one structured public data source API (e.g., a free-tier business directory or an open government database) to the agent's toolset. This will test the system's ability to merge data from both unstructured (crawled) and structured (API) sources, providing a more realistic validation.

*   **Gap: Ethical and Robust Crawling Strategy.**
    *   **Observation:** The plan mentions "crawling" but lacks specifics. A naive implementation can lead to being IP-blocked or inefficiently parsing JavaScript-heavy sites.
    *   **Recommendation:**
        1.  Implement a check for `robots.txt` before crawling any domain.
        2.  Use a headless browser (e.g., Puppeteer) for the crawling step to handle dynamic content rendering.
        3.  Introduce a configurable delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the target server.

### Strengthening Technical Resilience

*   **Resilience: Job Idempotency.**
    *   **Observation:** A user could accidentally trigger the same enrichment job multiple times.
    *   **Recommendation:** Make the job creation endpoint idempotent. Before creating a new job, the API should check if an active or recently completed job for the same domain exists. If so, it should return the status of the existing job instead of creating a new one.

*   **Resilience: Dead-Letter Queue for Failed Jobs.**
    *   **Observation:** Simply logging errors can make re-processing failed jobs difficult.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a simple "Dead-Letter Queue" pattern. Create a `failed_jobs` table in Postgres. When an enrichment step fails irrecoverably, the agent should write the job payload and error details to this table. This isolates failures for later inspection and manual replay.

### Additional Tests & Hardening Tasks

*   **Hardening: Input Sanitization.**
    *   **Observation:** The domain input field is a potential, albeit low-risk, attack vector.
    *   **Recommendation:** Add basic input validation and sanitization on the backend API to prevent any malicious scripts or malformed data from entering the system.

*   **Testing: Concurrent Job Simulation.**
    *   **Observation:** The system's behavior under parallel load is unknown.
    *   **Recommendation:** Before final validation, create a simple test script to trigger 5-10 enrichment jobs concurrently. This will help identify any immediate race conditions or resource contention issues.

*   **Testing: Graceful Handling of "No Results".**
    *   **Observation:** A successful run might yield zero valid facts.
    *   **Recommendation:** Add an explicit E2E test case for a domain known to have no manufacturing sites. Ensure the UI displays a clear "No facts found" message instead of showing an error or an empty, broken state.

2. Set up development environment and external services (Postgres, Pinecone)
3. Begin Milestone 1: Foundation & Setup
4. Execute tickets in priority order
5. Conduct regular milestone reviews and plan adjustments as needed
